AI GENERATED, COULD BE NONSENSE
Sure, here's a list of basic coding problems suitable for a beginner learning Dart. These tasks will help you familiarize yourself with the syntax and some basic constructs of the Dart programming language.

1. **Hello, World!**
   Write a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **Basic Data Types**
   Write a program that declares and prints different data types (e.g., String, int, double, bool) in Dart.

3. **Control Flow**
   Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it's even or odd.

4. **Lists and Looping**
   Write a program that creates a list of integers and then uses a loop to print out each value.

5. **Function to Sum Numbers**
   Write a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

6. **String Manipulation**
   Write a program that reverses and prints a given string.

7. **Recursion**
   Write a recursive function that computes the factorial of a given number.

8. **Classes and Objects**
   Define a class `Rectangle` with attributes `length` and `width`. Implement methods to calculate the area and the perimeter of the rectangle.

9. **Inheritance**
   Extend the above `Rectangle` class to create a `Square` class.

10. **Lists and Maps**
    Write a program that counts the occurrence of each word in a string using a Map.

11. **Exception Handling**
    Write a program that demonstrates the use of try, catch, and finally statements. 

12. **Working with Future**
    Write a program that simulates an asynchronous operation using Dart's Future.

13. **Reading and Writing to a File**
    Write a program that writes some text to a file and then reads it back.

14. **Sorting Algorithm**
    Implement a basic sorting algorithm like Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.

15. **Basic GUI Application**
    Try to create a basic GUI application using Flutter, which uses Dart as its primary programming language.

Remember to run and test your code after writing each solution to ensure it works as expected. Happy coding!
